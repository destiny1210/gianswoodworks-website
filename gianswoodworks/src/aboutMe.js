                Hi, my name is Giancarlo Manzaba and I’m the designer and craftsman at Gian’s
                Woodworks. I reside in San Antonio, TX, and serve all its’ surrounding areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to start by thanking you for taking the time to visit Gian&#39;s Woodworks.
                The journey of building furniture started in 2018 and what began as a hobby to pass
                time, rapidly became a passion. My love for woodworking goes beyond cutting
                and putting wood together. It is all about the details, especially those unseen. I’m
                a true believer of building unique furniture, something that will fit your style and
                space with the build quality of a timeless piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you are looking for a cutting board or a large statement piece, your
                imagination and my craftsman skills will deliver that and more.
            </p>
